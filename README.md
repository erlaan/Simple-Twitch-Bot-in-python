# Simple Twitch Bot In python

## About:

Simple Twitch bot is build by me. It is tested with Python 3.7.3 and it works

## How to run the bot
1. Open bot.py with your favorite editor and add the oauth, username and the channel to join
2. start it by typing python bot.py (If you have duel python version installed and the default is python 2.7 you need to type python3 to start the bot) 

## TODO
- [] Clean the code up.
- [x] port it to python3
- [] Add some good functions
